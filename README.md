# Advantages of GraphQL:

### GraphQL is declarative: 
   Query responses are decided by the client rather than the server. A GraphQL query returns exactly what a client asks for and no more.

### GraphQL is compositional: 
   A GraphQL query itself is a hierarchical set of fields. The query is shaped just like the data it returns. It is a natural way for product engineers to describe data requirements.

### GraphQL is strongly-typed: 
  A GraphQL query can be ensured to be valid within a GraphQL type system at development time allowing the server to make guarantees about the response. This makes it easier to build high-quality client tools
